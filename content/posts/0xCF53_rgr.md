One of my garage remotes stopped working but I kept it in hope one day I'd make a learning exercise out of repairing it.

The other day somehow I brought it up in a conversation and it was highlighted that it is common for the push button to wear out, so I opened the remote and quickly tested by shorting over the button with a wire.  
And the garage door opened (thanks Dad)!
