While keeping the OTP generator in the same machine where you use the OTP itself is unlikely to be endorsed by the security team, Vasco already provides that with Digipass For Windows (even if EOL is April 2022).
Challenge accepted, took a set of valid credentials1, the installer2 and fired up a brand new IDA VM.</description></item><item><title>0x0000 The Seed</title><link>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0x0000_the_seed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 01:37:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0x0000_the_seed/</guid><description>Sometimes we need something and we can&amp;rsquo;t find a straight up how-to online.
We put a few pieces together, get it done but wonder if we ever need to do it again, will we find the same resources again? Will they be up? Will we follow the same links?
We want to record our steps to remember later on, but we also want Google to index them so we get there, so why not post them up somewhere?</description></item></channel></rss>
