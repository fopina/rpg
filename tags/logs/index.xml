I also started using it for telemetry though I never updated the post with those details.
Since Google refactored their Monitoring away from that crappy StackDriver interface, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite nice, so might as well write the setup down (up? ☁️).
Even though GCP monitoring seems oriented to metrics from GCP services it also allows you to create logs-based metrics.</description></item><item><title>0xD755 Free Log Collection</title><link>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0xd755_gcp_logging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 00:47:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0xd755_gcp_logging/</guid><description>I have a few raspberries lying around the house plus a couple of really cheap low-end VPS (1€ arubas)
Not only they there are containers, cron jobs, etc spread among them (but all keep under ansible control) 2 of them are a docker swarm cluster with replicas for same services.
Eventually I need to check logs for something (and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep tabs on cpu/memory/disk metrics), so I started looking into log management/collection solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
