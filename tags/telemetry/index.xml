I also started using it for telemetry though I never updated the post with those details.
Since Google refactored their Monitoring away from that crappy StackDriver interface, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite nice, so might as well write the setup down (up? ☁️).
Even though GCP monitoring seems oriented to metrics from GCP services it also allows you to create logs-based metrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
