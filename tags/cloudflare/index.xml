Traefik is used to expose (most of) the swarm services and some of these services are exposed to the internet.
Traefik docker-compose includes these flags
- --entrypoints.http.address=:80- --entrypoints.https.address=:443- --entrypoints.https_external.address=:8443Home router has port forwarding from 443 to 8443 on one of the manager nodes (where Traefik runs). Binding services to http (80) or https (443) exposes them internally only, binding to https_external (8443) exposes them to the internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
