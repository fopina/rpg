FluentBit was the agent of choice at the time but Telegraf seemed like a good candidate now.
Why fluentd has a lot of plugins but its crappy ruby codebase eats way too many resources for me (why would anyone?) to use it.
Luckily, the same guys gave it an extreme makeover in C and called it fluentbit.</description></item><item><title>0x9B4B Free Telemetry</title><link>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0x9b4b_gcp_metrics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 02:54:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0x9b4b_gcp_metrics/</guid><description>Some time ago I wrote about leveraging GCP free tier for log collection. I also started using it for telemetry though I never updated the post with those details.
Since Google refactored their Monitoring away from that crappy StackDriver interface, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite nice, so might as well write the setup down (up? ☁️).
Even though GCP monitoring seems oriented to metrics from GCP services it also allows you to create logs-based metrics.</description></item><item><title>0xD755 Free Log Collection</title><link>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0xd755_gcp_logging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 00:47:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rpg.skmobi.com/posts/0xd755_gcp_logging/</guid><description>I have a few raspberries lying around the house plus a couple of really cheap low-end VPS (1€ arubas)
Not only they there are containers, cron jobs, etc spread among them (but all keep under ansible control) 2 of them are a docker swarm cluster with replicas for same services.
Eventually I need to check logs for something (and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep tabs on cpu/memory/disk metrics), so I started looking into log management/collection solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
