While keeping the OTP generator in the same machine where you use the OTP itself is unlikely to be endorsed by the security team, Vasco already provides that with Digipass For Windows (even if EOL is April 2022).
Challenge accepted, took a set of valid credentials1, the installer2 and fired up a brand new IDA VM.</description></item></channel></rss>
