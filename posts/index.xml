			<description>Sometimes we need something and we can&amp;rsquo;t find a straight up how-to online.
We put a few pieces together, get it done but wonder if we ever need to do it again, will we find the same resources again? Will they be up? Will we follow the same links?
We want to record our steps to remember later on, but we also want Google to index them so we get there, so why not post them up somewhere?</description>

<p>We put a few pieces together, get it done but wonder if we ever need to do it again, will we find the same resources again? Will they be up? Will we follow the same links?</p>

<p>We want to record our steps to remember later on, but we also want Google to index them so we get there, so why not post them up somewhere?</p>

<p>Internet is not running out of space.</p>

<p>In my case, I decided to dump everything here, RPG.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with how to set up a blog like this one:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></li>
<li>on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
<li>&hellip; with <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">custom CNAME</a></li>
<li>published by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/</a></p>
