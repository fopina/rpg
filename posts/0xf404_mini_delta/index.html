Whole content backed up (and shared) <a href=https://github.com/fopina/mp-mini-delta-cura/tree/main/original-but-old>here</a>.</p><p>But no Mac version. Googling a bit <code>Cura 15</code> was a legacy version, it was now <a href=https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura>Ultimaker Cura</a> and new version scheme.<br>So I download that one. Surprise, USB printing had been removed.</p><p>But WiFi printing is supported. I saw WiFi mentioned in the manual, let&rsquo;s set it up!<br>The manual says to download <code>MP 3D Printer WiFi Connect</code> app from Play Store or iTunes, but no direct links.<br>I look them up, nothing. There was only an app called <code>MP Mini 3D Printer Client & Connect.</code> (but no longer available either today) but it was from random individual (later found out he was part of the <a href=https://www.mpminidelta.com/>MP community</a>) not from Monoprice. And only for Android.</p><p>So I drop them an email:</p><blockquote><p>From: me<br>Received: Thu Nov 14 2019 16:35:16 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)<br>To: <a href=mailto:tech@monoprice.com>tech@monoprice.com</a>; Technical Support;<br>Subject: wifi connect mobile app</p><p>Hello, where can I find the mobile apps for wifi connection?

Search &ldquo;MP 3D Printer Wifi Connect&rdquo; one of the first options after searching should be &ldquo;MP Mini 3D Printer Client & Connect.&rdquo; Download that program and follow the instructions. There is also instructions inside the manual for the MP Mini Delta 3D Printer. If you don&rsquo;t have the manual on hand you can go to the Monoprice website search the printer, at the bottom of the printer product page is a link to the Manual. If you have any other questions or need any help I am more than happy to help out. Have a great day!</p></blockquote><p>I reply that I had done it but it wasn&rsquo;t the official app, so they say:</p><blockquote><p>From: Tech <a href=mailto:Tech@monoprice.com>Tech@monoprice.com</a><br>Nov 15, 2019, 7:14 PM</p><p>Thank you for the additional information. I am new and it was brought to my attention that that particular program is not an official app, I&rsquo;m sorry for suggesting that one. Unfortunately the best we could do is suggest you go to the Wiki community page that it sounds like you already went to and follow their tutorials, besides that we can&rsquo;t assist with the Wifi connection because we don&rsquo;t currently have any official applications or guides to assist with. Just in case we are talking about two different websites I will provide the link to the Wiki page we always suggest. Outside of that I do want to make sure that it is known that our 3D Printers all only work off a 2.4ghz Wifi signal, so the first thing I would do is make sure you are trying to connect to a 2.4ghz Wifi signal. If I can assist in any other way, please E-mail me back. Have a great day!

I&rsquo;d still be pratical if I could just load the prints that way (after slicing in Cura).<br>But no, at 9% upload, every time, printer stops responding and only turning it off and back on makes it reponsive again&mldr; Tried another (smaller) .gcode and same&mldr;</p><p>I ping the support again</p><blockquote><p>Understood, just to confirm you are running the printer on a 2.4ghz Wifi correct? The SD card should only have the gcode file on it, if it has anything else you might want to clear it out. As per it failing, even when the Wifi setup is working correct there is always a chance that a file will fail when trying to upload a file through Wifi. From our experience we&rsquo;ve notice that SD card printing is much more reliable than Wifi printing as there are no issues with file transfer. SD card has the best resolution over Wifi and USB. Wifi at best is finicky on transferring files over to the SD card and can experience lag drops. If you have any other questions please E-mail me back.</p></blockquote><p>Again, printer supports WiFi officially but <code>it's flaky and you should use SD card (not even USB)</code>&mldr;</p><h2 id=octoprint>Octoprint<a href=#octoprint class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>Gave up on WiFi.</p><p>Every 3D print search eventually goes through some <a href=https://octoprint.org/>octoprint</a> link.
