      <description>I needed a symbolic gift some time ago and thought a lenticular keychain but shops I found to get a custom made one would take over 2 weeks to deliver.
Googling a bit for DIY seems the only thing required to print lenticulars is image processing and lenticular lens. Again, getting lenticular lens was not so easy as it looked, so off and found this video, that looks easy!</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need something and we can&amp;rsquo;t find a straight up how-to online.
We put a few pieces together, get it done but wonder if we ever need to do it again, will we find the same resources again? Will they be up? Will we follow the same links?
We want to record our steps to remember later on, but we also want Google to index them so we get there, so why not post them up somewhere?</description>
